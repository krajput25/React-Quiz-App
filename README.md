# React-applications

Hello!
This code represents a General Knowledge Quiz that helps the user choose answers to five questions during a single attempt, 
and instantaneously displayes the score that the user obtained. It also gives you the option to play again. The quiz offers a 
fresh set of questions on each attempt. This project involves majority of the code written using CSS and React and has been made with the help 
of Create-React-App. 

The deployed, fully-functional app is available here: https://general-knowledge-quiz-app.netlify.app/

Thank you!
